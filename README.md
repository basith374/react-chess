# Chess Game (React)

A simple chess game built using React. This project features a fully interactive chessboard with SVG-based piece assets and movement mechanics. While piece movement rules are implemented, checkmate detection and endgame logic are still a work in progress.

## Demo

Check out the live demo [here](https://basith374.github.io/react-chess)

## Features

- **React-powered UI** – The game is built using React for a smooth and dynamic experience.
- **SVG Chess Pieces** – Uses SVG assets to render different chess pieces.
- **Grid-based Board** – The chessboard is structured using CSS `display: grid` for flexible styling and responsiveness.
- **Piece Movement** – Implements movement mechanics for all chess pieces according to standard chess rules.

## TODO

- Implement checkmate and stalemate detection.
- Add game-over conditions.
- Improve UI/UX with animations and move indicators.
- Implement castling, en passant, and pawn promotion.
- Add a move history and undo functionality.
- Potential AI or multiplayer integration in the future.
